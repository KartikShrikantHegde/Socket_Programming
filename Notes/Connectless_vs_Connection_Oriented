2 transport protocol used over internet is TCP and UDP.


UDP:  Connectionless communication: (Since there is no guarantee of the delivery)

Important Characteristics : Analogy is postal network

1. Just like postboxes, UDP must have the every recipeint endpoint address. 
2. There is no guarantee of the delivery.
3. It is best effort delivery service. It may lose datagrams. 
4. Messeges will not arrive in the order they were sent. Because over  a WAN, there may be multiple routes available to reach the destination from source A to destnination B.
5. Messege size or boundaries are preserved from source to destination. Therefore if receiver wants to reply it needs to know the source address which sent the messege.

TCP:  Connection-Oriented communication: (Since there is guarantee of the delivery)

Important Characteristics : Analogy is telephone network

1. Caller 1 has phone no up front only once. Caller 2 must recieve the call when the connection is established. 
   Caller 1 needs to know the phone no of the caller 2, but caller 2 need not remeember anything.
2. There is guarantee of the delivery through diff acknowledgements.
3. Messege boundaries are not preserved. Sender might send 300,100,200 bytes of data and reciever recieves 600 bytes as total.


Client-Servers:

Client also has port no which is irrelevant and an IP address.

Server sitting on the machine has the IP and many diff ports each listening for specific services.
Eg: web server - port 80, ssh -> port 22 etc..
